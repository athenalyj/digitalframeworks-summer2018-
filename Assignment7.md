# Assignment 7: Find a Story

I found that during the 2016 election cycle, a great number of journalism school professors contributed to political campaigns, even though the [SPJ](https://www.spj.org/ethics-papers-politics.asp) specifies that journalists should not "get involved" or "contribute money" for political campaigns.

This is an intersting issue because technically journalism school professors are not journalists who should follow the SPJ codes. However, they teach future journalists with words and action. If they say donating to campaigns is unethical in class but donate money themselves, it might not be a good model for students. 

I would interview the SPJ Ethics Committee to see what a role journalism professors should play in this issue. I would also talk to professors who donated money and those who did not to get opinions from both sides. 

I would also like to check the former election cycles to see if there is a trend that more journalism school professors are getting involved in political activities. 
This story would be finished in two days.   

In order to find my story, I did the following:

1. Searched the FEC website for donations in the 2016 election cycle from employees of "Journalism" and downloaded the .csv file 
2. For the CSV, I: 
    * deleted blank columns
    * Got rid of data points that do not represent a journalism school faculty
    * took the sum of the contributor names: 8
    * took the sum of the money they donated respectively

Hed: Unethical or Reasonable? Eight Journalism School Faculty Donated Money to Political Campaigns during the 2016 Cycle  

Nut graf: Despite the SPJ codes that prohibit journalists from involving in political activities, eight journalism school faculty donated money to political campaigns during the 2016 election cycle. The maximum amount reported by the FEC was $2125* from a director at UC Berkley.  

* There appears to be some amendment to the actual amount of the contribution, but I was unable to open the original documents.
