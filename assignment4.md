# Assignment 4: Story Pitch
 ## Story idea: How hard it is for Sloane Stephens to defend her US Open? 
The story will analyze the prospect of Stephens defending her 2017 US Open championship by looking at two databases - the performance of all former female US Open defending champions at the year they came back and Stephens' draw this year (possibly as the 3rd seed), which will be announced at August 25th or 26th. Both the databases will need to be collected and created by my own, but statistics are available on [a Wikipedia list of the former US Open champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_US_Open_women%27s_singles_champions), [WTA players index](http://www.wtatennis.com/players) and [the offical site of the 2018 US Open](https://www.usopen.org/index.html).

The first database itself is very visual. For example, questions like "which round did the defending champion reach" can be demonstrated as a line chart or scatter diagram while "how strong their oppoents were" can be presented as a bar chart. The second section may be more direct if shown as a draw with Stephen's potential opponents from each round.

This would be a timely story because the US Open starts at the end of August and Stephens is playing good this year. Her current world ranking is No.3 whereas when she won the championship she only ranked No.83. The expectation that she defends it is high.

I could talk to senior Tennis columnists about their observation on Stephens games this year. I also have quotes from Stephens on her expectations towards the US Open.
