# Stats Show It’s Getting Harder to Defend the U.S. Open Title, but Hope Remains for Sloane Stephens

When Sloane Stephens entered the 2017 U.S. Open, ranking world No. 957 after an 11-month injury layoff, no one would expect the 24-year-old advancing all the way to the final and taking home her first Grand Slam title.  

One year later, the Cinderella returns to Flushing, New York as world No. 3. Now, everyone wonders how possible it is for her to defend the title.  

Looking at her performance this year as well as her career tournament-final results, Stephens has reasons to be confident. But the historical data may disappoint her a bit: statistics show that defending a U.S. Open championship has become increasingly difficult over the years, especially on the women’s side.

To understand the reason why reclaiming a title gets harder, we quantified and rated each player’s path of defending the U.S. Open by assigning point values to their opponents of each round, according to their seeds. 

Under all circumstances, the first seeded player gets 32 points, the second seeded gets 31 and so forth until the 32nd seeded player gets 1 point. A zero was assigned to all unseeded players. After adding up all point values of the defending player’s opponents, we curved the sum under a 100-point scale to obtain the corresponding difficulty rate. The higher the rate turns out, the harder the path of defending was.

Here is what the result looks like:

Interestingly, unlike the men’s side where seven tennis legends managed to keep the title for at least two years in a row, there is no sign of dominance in women’s competition throughout the years. 

Since its launch in 1968, the U.S. Open has only witnessed its trophy reclaimed by the same female players for 14 times, 10 of which were before the 2000s. Only two players were able to defend more than once in a row. Other than that, 17.95 percent defending players became runner-ups, 15.38 percent got knocked out in semifinals, 12.82 percent lost in quarterfinals and 25.64 percent did not make it to the second week at all.

The difficulty rate of defending reached its peak between mid-1980s and mid 2000s, during when Martina Navratilova clinched a 100-point hard-fought win in 1987, after beating #14 Catarina Lindqvist, #8 Gabriela Sabatini, #6 Helena Suková and #1 Steffi Graf. Venus Williams, in 2001, though only scored 97.09, became the first U.S. Open defending champion that had to play five seeded players, with three of them having topped the WTA world rankings at some point of their careers.

Based on the difficulty rate, Steffi Graf had the luckiest draw in 1996 and totally cashed it. The then WTA No.1 routed all unseeded opponents in the first five rounds, defeated #16 Martina Hingis in semifinal and #2 Monica Seles in the final to win her fifth and also last U.S. Open title, without playing a tiebreaker or three setter.

Since then, few defending players could take advantage of a lucky draw, despite the fact that the competition at the U.S. Open has become unprecedentedly wide open in the 21st century. While more players, including Stephens, are able to enjoy the excitement of winning a Grand Slam title and reenter the tournament with an easier draw, they must also face the reality that they often get kicked out before week two in their defending year.

In 2004, #1 Justin Henin fell in R16 to the first seeded player she met. One year later, Svetlana Kuznetsova became the first defending champion in tournament history that got eliminated in the first round. In 2007, Maria Sharapova struggled in R32 but could not overcome #30 Agnieszka Radwańska. With four consecutive Grand Slam titles at hand, Serena, the then queen of tennis, was upsetted by unseeded Roberta Vinci in 2015. Last year, Angelique Kerber became the second defending champion to lose in the first round after Kuznetsova. 

The last time someone was able to defend the U.S. Open was Serena in 2014. She got a pretty good difficulty rate at only 59.22. Stephens, however, is not that lucky. If all seeded players are able to move past lower-ranked players this year, the difficulty rate of Stephens defending the U.S. Open will be an astounding 111.65.

Stephens, the headliner in Section 3, will take on Evgeniya Rodina in the first round, followed by a qualifier in the second. Potentially, she could play either #25 Dania Gavrilova or wild card Victoria Azarenka, who holds a 3-2 record against her, in R32. Good news is Stephens has figured out a way to overcome Azarenka – Stephens outlasted the former WTA No.1 twice this year, both on hard court. Should she advance to the fourth round, Stephens may have the opportunity to revenge on #15 Elise Mertens, to whom she lost in straight sets this year at Cincinnati. 

#7 Elina Svitolina and #1 Simona Halep loom as Stephens’ potential quarterfinal and semifinal rivals, respectively. Stephens has lost to Halep twice in tournament finals this year and has lost six matches in a row. #2 Caroline Wozniacki, 6-1 when facing Stephens, could be waiting for the defending champion in the final.

What also adds to the uncertainty is Stephens’ performance in recent Grand Slams appearances. After taking home her first Grand Slam title last year at the U.S. Open, Stephens got knocked out in the first round at the Australian Open in January. She found her way back at Roland-Garros by routing three seeded players to reach the final and lost to No.1 Halep, but once again stopped at the first round at Wimbledon. 

Despite the history of the tournament and her tough draw, the results of this year’s competition are still to be written by Stephens herself, according to Chris Herring, senior sports writer for FiveThirtyEight. 

“Data helps tell us what we can expect, but players can always defy the odds,” said Herring. He added that the increasing difficulty rate only “captures what normally happens,” so chances are Stephens may “come along and break or change it.”

So, given the historical lessons and her own condition, it is a good idea for Stephens to temporarily forget about the ambition of defending the championship and just focus on the first couple of matches. It is possible that some “dangerous” opponents, including Gavrilova, Azarenka and Svitolina, who are not at their best currently, may get eliminated before challenging Stephens. Players like Halep and Wozniacki, on the other hand, have their own tough battles to fight in their sections, too. From that perspective, the actual difficulty rate could drop significantly once the tournament starts.  

“Hopefully some things will connect in the next few weeks leading into the U.S. Open,” she said after losing to Andrea Petkovic at the Citi Open, “just focus on playing my game, executing better, just getting some more matches.”

“At her best, Stephens has the offense, defense, and consistency to dominate anyone on hard courts,” said ESPN tennis analyst Patrick McEnroe. “There's a great likelihood that if Sloane doesn't go out in the early rounds, you'll probably see her in the late stages of the tournament."
