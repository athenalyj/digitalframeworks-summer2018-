# Assignment 5: Interview a dataset

The database I interviewed: [Results of the former U.S. Open female defending champions.]()(This would be expanded to include both men's and women's later.)

### Q1: How far did the former U.S. Open defending champions go, in general?
A: Of the 49 U.S. Open defending champions, 28.57 percent defended their titles, 17.95 percent became runner-ups, 15.38 percent advanced to the semifinals, 12.82 percent to the quarterfinals and 25.64 percent did not make to the finals.

### Q2: Which defending champion had the best draw and fully took advantage of it?
A: Steffi Graf in 1996. The then world No.1 entered the U.S. Open in 1996 as the first seeded player and defended her title. But she did not play a seeded player until the semifinal, which was very uncommon. She defeated #16 Martina Hingis and #2 Monica Seles, against whom she held winning records, in the semifinal and final, respectively, without a tiebreaker or three setter.

### Q3: What does the hardest journey to defend a champion look like in the U.S. Open?
A: In 2001, the fourth seeded Venus Williams denfended her U.S. Open title by overcoming five seeded players - #30 Lisa Raymond, #18 Sandrine Testud, #5 Kim Clijsters, #2 Jennifer Capriati and #10 Serena Williams. Three of them were world No.1 at some point of their careers. Williams is the defending champion that played the most seeded opponents in the tournament history. However, she finished all matches in straight sets and did not even play a tiebreaker. 

## How I created the database and processed the data
1. Collect all data from Wikipedia pages and [WTAtennis.com](http://www.wtatennis.com/headtohead).
2. Additionally, write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas. 
3. Lastly, write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.

This analysis can be related to your final project, but does not have to be.
