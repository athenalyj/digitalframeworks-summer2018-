### Final project ideas:
  1. What are Team USA's weapons to beat their pool opponents - For FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship. Look at pool opponent's key stats to see what strategy Team USA should adopt against each opponent in their pool.
  2. Who's United State's "Grand Slam" player? - For the US Open. Look at the stats of USA's tennis players and analyze who perform better in Grand Slams. 

# Data reporting critiques - [When Federer Wins The First Point On Serve, It’s Usually Game Over](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/when-federer-wins-the-first-point-on-serve-its-usually-game-over/)

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? __5__ 
   * What was it? __Federer has a higer winning percentage in serve games when he wins the first point.__
   * Was it in the headline? __Yes.__
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? __4__
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? __Yes, because the writer used the most direct data from different angles.__
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? __I would do a chart to compare Federer's winning percentage when he is 15-0, 30-0, 40-0 amd 0-15 instead of describing those records with paragraphs. It might be clearer and more convincing.__
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? __5__
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. __None.__
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. __The Wimbledon.__
   * Did they provide a source? __Yes, under each chart or after each reference.__
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? __Yes. I think it is enough for FiveThirtyEight's target readers - veteran sports fans.__

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? __5__
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. __The story is concise and direct, but I think some data is better to be presented by charts/graphs. Now it only has one chart, while some other statistics can also be visualized.__
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? __Almost.__
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish __The compare part can be stronger, as stated in the previous questions.__

### Objective: Type and color (if piece includes graphics)

* Based on your knowledge of color and type use, did this person use type (as in typography, fonts) and color to their best purpose?
   * For example, did it: 
       * Look like it all belonged together?
       * Draw your eye first to the most important pieces of information?
       * Make sense? For example, if it discussed heat, did it use the color red to communicate the degree of heat rather than, say, blue?
* Type (1-5)
   * Explain
*Color (1-5)
   * Explain
   
### Objective: Creativity

* Did the piece use some creative elements to good effect? As in, to emphasize those areas that could draw someone in, or to add detail where needed, but not just random visual or story junk that distracts you? __No. It is a typical data journalistic piece.__
   * How?
   * Rate effectiveness on scale of 1-5. 
   
  
  # Data reporting critiques - [The World Cup Players Who Step Up Most For Their Countries](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-world-cup-players-who-step-up-most-for-their-countries/)

### Objective: Clarity and accuracy

* Were you able to immediately identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate? __5__ 
   * What was it? __Use data to identify different types of players: those who stand out on international stages and those who are more successful at the league level.__
   * Was it in the headline? __The problem is clearly shown, but unlike the first story, it does not present the answer directly.__
* Were you able to quickly understand how you would navigate the data? __5__
   * Was that the most efficient way to navigate? __Yes.__
   * Can you suggest ways to improve navigation? __The data itself is sound, but I feel it is not enough to prove that certain players perform better on national/league level, because other variables may apply (e.g. teammates, their roles in the team, strategies, etc.)__
* Using your own knowledge and critical thinking abilities, do you think the data was accurate? __4__
   * List any areas where you question the accuracy of the data. __None.__
   * List sources you would suggest the reporter check with. __I think ESPN is pretty official on this, but I would definitely refer to the team websites or FIFA as well.__
   * Did they provide a source? __Yes, under each chart or after each reference.__
   * Did they explain everything that needed explaining? __No. I am still a little bit confused about "DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CLUB AND NATIONAL TEAM." Was it [CLUB - NATIONAL] or [NATIONAL - CLUB]?__

### Objective: Quality

* Regardless of the form that the graphic/story takes, was it executed at a high degree of quality? __5__
   * Explain what they did well and areas where improvements could be made. __They use gradient colors and different font weight to show differences, making results clearer to see.__
* Consider some tasks a data story must do well: (present, compare, organize, correlate)
   * Did this graphic accomplish all tasks? __Almost.__
   * If not, which ones did it not accomplish __The formulas used should be explained in a more direct way.__
